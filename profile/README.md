# Coding CPP

I've done and will do some coding in C++, solving some problems by making some projects, primarily for fun and learning.

What I aim to achieve by creating this organization is to attract similar minded people to collaborate on projects, learn from each other and have fun.

One more reason was that I was fed up with was that the only projects on C++ available on popular forums and website were management systems or variants of it. I wanted to do something different, something that I would enjoy doing.
